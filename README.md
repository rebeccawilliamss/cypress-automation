# Introduction 
Ten10 consultants started working on the automation Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline and automated regression testing for the Historic England Inventory project in December 2020. The main benefits of CI are to find defects as soon as possible when new automation builds are pushed to the central repository (repo), to have the most business-critical functions tested by automated testing on a daily basis, and to partly replace the manual regression testing that is not time efficient to be carried out as frequently.
